I took a nav bar i'd previously made, and figured i should be adding my contact info to every app i make. Why not. 
Next i made a counter function, starting first with the useState for the increment/decrement buttons and then adding useEffect to change the document title simultaneously. Next i worked on a greeting component, where I will be using hooks to make a login feature. I added the input feature, to make the current state be first name and last name. Then i used state instead to first store it in local storage, and then have that persist using useEffect hook.
